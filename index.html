      <p>Introduction</p>
      <p>This API allows users to check if a certain food is safe for dogs to eat. The API utilizes a database of known safe and unsafe foods for dogs and returns a response indicating whether the requested food is safe or not.</p>
      <p>Endpoint</p>
      <p>The API has a single endpoint that accepts GET requests in the following format:</p>
      <pre>https://dog-food-api.onrender.com/{food_name}</pre>
      <p>Where <code>{food_name}</code> is the name of the food the user wants to check.</p>
      <p>Response</p>
      <p>The API returns a JSON object with the following properties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>food</strong> (string): The name of the food that was queried.</li>
        <li><strong>status</strong> (string): Indicates whether the food is safe for dogs to eat (<code>"safe"</code>) or not (<code>"unsafe"</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>message</strong> (string): Additional information about the food and why it is or is not safe for dogs to eat.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kBgNo1P.png" alt="JSON OBJ" />
      <p>A GET request to the endpoint <code>https://api.dogfoodcompatibility.com/food/chicken</code> will return the following response:</p>
      <pre>
{
    "food": "chicken",
    "status": "safe",
    "message": "Chicken is a lean protein source that is safe for dogs to eat in small amounts. It should be cooked and served plain, without any seasonings or sauces."
}
      </pre>
      <p>Error Handling</p>
      <p>If the API is unable to find a match for the requested food in its database, it will return a response with the following properties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>status</strong>: <code>"error"</code></li>
        <li><strong>message</strong>: <code>"Food not found in database"</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>If an invalid endpoint is requested, the API will return a response with the following properties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>status</strong>: <code>"error"</code></li>
        <li><message</strong>: <code>"Invalid endpoint"</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note</strong></p>
    <p>This API is for reference only and should not be used as a substitute for professional veterinary advice. Always consult a veterinarian before introducing new foods to your dog's diet.</p>
